Calendar App
This is a simple React application built with TypeScript and Vite. It includes a calendar component and a schedule component. The calendar allows users to navigate through months and select specific days, and the schedule displays events for the selected day.

Getting Started
These instructions will help you set up and run the project on your local machine.

Prerequisites
Make sure you have the following software installed on your machine:

Node.js
npm (comes with Node.js)
Installation
Clone the repository:

bash
Copy code
git clone https://github.com/your-username/react-calendar-app.git
Navigate to the project folder:

bash
Copy code
cd react-calendar-app
Install dependencies:

bash
Copy code
npm install
Usage
Run the development server:

bash
Copy code
npm run dev
Open your browser and navigate to the dynamically generated localhost path. If you are using a code editor that supports it (e.g., Visual Studio Code), you can also use the "Alt/Command + Click" feature on the path to open it directly in your default browser.

Example:

In Visual Studio Code, hover over the localhost path in the terminal, hold down the "Alt" key (Windows/Linux) or "Command" key (Mac), and click on the path to open it in your default browser.
Features
Calendar Component: Allows navigation through months, selection of specific days, and highlights the selected day.

Schedule Component: Displays events for the selected day. Currently, the schedule is populated with placeholder events.

Customization
Feel free to customize and extend the app based on your requirements. You can modify the calendar styles, add additional features, or integrate real data for the schedule.
