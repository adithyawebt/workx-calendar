# WorkX Plugins

This is a simple React application built with TypeScript and Vite. It includes a calendar component and a schedule component. The calendar allows users to navigate through months and select specific days, and the schedule displays events for the selected day.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

Make sure you have the following software installed on your machine:

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/)
- [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/) (comes with Node.js)

### Installation

1. Clone the repository using SSH:

   ```bash
   git clone git@github.com:adithyawebt/workx-calendar.git
2. Navigate to the project folder:
```
cd workx-calendar
```

3. Install dependencies:

```
npm install
```
## Usage
Run the development server:

```
npm run dev
```
Open your browser and navigate to the dynamically generated localhost path. If you are using a code editor that supports it (e.g., Visual Studio Code), you can also use the "Alt/Command + Click" feature on the path to open it directly in your default browser.

## Components 
Calendar Component: Allows navigation through months, selection of specific days, and highlights the selected day.

Schedule Component: Displays events for the selected day. Currently, the schedule is populated with placeholder events.
